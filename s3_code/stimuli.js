        <strong>Overview:</strong>
        <br>
        In this experiment, you will observe and evaluate a player's actions in a decision-making game.
        Specifically, you will see decisions made by a player from a previous experiment and evaluate the information that the player was working with at the time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Basic rules of the game:</strong>
        <br>
        The player started with a score of 0 coins. Their goal was to gain as many coins as they could by collecting payments. 
        Each round, they chose between two options. Option 1 was labeled with the exact amount of coins that it would award, 
        but Option 2 was labeled with a rough approximation of the amount of coins it would award.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, if the player chose Option 1, they were guaranteed to gain the amount of coins displayed.
        But if they chose Option 2, they only knew that they would gain somewhere near the amount of coins displayed.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>

        <strong>What you will do:</strong>
        <br>
        In this experiment, you will go through each round that a previous player played. 
        First, you will see the exact value of Option 1 and the approximate value of Option 2. Then, you will see which option the previous player chose. 
        Finally, you will see the exact value of Option 2, which the previous player <u>did not see, even after making their choice</u>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you have all the information, you will be asked some questions about the round. After you answer them, the next round will begin.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, to make the game more interesting for you, your bonus for this experiment will grow as the previous player collects payments. 
        Specifically, for every in-game coin that the previous player gained, your bonus will increase by ${ratios[which_list]} cents. 
        For example, if the previous player's final score was 2500 coins, your bonus will be $${(2500 * ratios[which_list] / 100).toFixed(2)}.
        The experiment will keep track of your score throughout, and the final value will be converted to a bonus.

            <strong>How were the approximations calculated?</strong>
            <br>
            In each round, the approximation of Option 2 was generated by a random other participant (<u>NOT</u> the player who was choosing between Option 1 and Option 2).
            <br>
            <br>
            These participants were shown the exact values for the options, and they were asked to write down approximations of them.
            We did not specify how they were supposed to approximate the values.
            So, while one participant might approximate an exact value of 86 to 90, another participant might approximate it to 85, 100, or another number they thought was reasonable.

        Think of this ladder as representing where people stand in the United States. 
        At the top of the ladder are the people who have the most money, most education, and most respected jobs. 
        At the bottom are the people who have the least money, least education, and least respected jobs/ no job. 
        The higher up you are on this ladder, the closer you are to the people at the very top. 
        The lower you are, the closer you are to the people at the very bottom.

    <strong>What was this study about?</strong>
    <br>
    In this study, we were trying to better understand how people decide what information should qualify as true or false.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's important to note that the decisions you saw from a "previous player" were not in fact from a previous player. 
    We chose which option was selected in each round that you observed. We also determined what the approximate amount shown in Option 2 was. 
    These approximations were not in fact determined by previous participants.
    <br>
    <br>
    We said that these two features were determined by previous participants because we're interested in how people evaluate the truth of information in real-world scenarios.
    We wanted our participants in this study to believe that they were seeing approximations that real people had created and the downstream decisions that real people made based on those approximations.
