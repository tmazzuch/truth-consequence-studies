    <p style=""text-align:left;"">
        You are being asked to participate in a research study titled ""Truth in Games."" 
        You were selected to participate in this project because you are an adult over age 18. 
        This study is sponsored by Boston College and the John Templeton Foundation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The purpose of this study is to understand how we weigh information what other people say. 
        This study will be conducted through this online survey. 
        The survey should take you about <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">16 minutes</span> to complete. 
        There are no direct benefits to you, 
        but you may feel gratified knowing that you helped further the scholarly work in this research area, 
        and you will be compensated <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$3.00</span> (with up to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$1.98 bonus available</span> as well) for your participation. 
        There are no costs to you associated with your participation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The researchers do not believe participation would entail any risks or discomforts beyond those ordinarily encountered in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        This Principal Investigator, Dr. Liane Young, will exert all reasonable efforts to keep your responses and your identity confidential. 
        We will not maintain within our research data any information that uniquely identifies you, such as your name, location, or Internet Protocol (IP) address. 
        In any report we publish, we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify a participant. 
        Data collected from the experiment will be coded to remove your name and any other personal identifiers. 
        All records will be secured in a locked cabinet in our lab. 
        The Institutional Review Board at Boston College and internal Boston College auditors may review the research records. 
        State or federal laws or court orders may also require that information from research study records be released. 
        Otherwise, the researchers will not release to others any information that could indicate your identity unless you give your permission, 
        or unless the researchers become legally required to do so.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Although the survey will not prompt you directly to identify yourself by name, email address or the like, 
        the survey will include several items that would prompt you to provide certain demographic information, 
        such as your age, gender, ethnicity, education level and the like. 
        In combination, responses to such questions could suggest your identity. 
        Regardless, please know that the researchers will make no purposeful effort to discern your identity based on such information. 
        Additionally, please note that you may opt to leave any such questions blank.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Your participation is voluntary. If you choose not to participate it will not affect your relations with Boston College. 
        Some questions on the survey, such as comprehension questions, may be required in order to complete the survey and receive compensation. 
        However, you may still choose to end your participation in the study at any time. 
        If you have questions or concerns concerning this research you may contact the Principal Investigator at 
        <a href=""tel:16175520240"">+1 (617) 552-0240</a> or <a href=""mailto:liane.young@bc.edu"">liane.young@bc.edu</a>.

        <strong>What was this study about?</strong>
        <br>
        In this study, we were trying to better understand how people decide what information should qualify as true or false.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's important to note that the estimations you saw from a ""previous Reporter"" were not in fact estimations made by a real person. 
        In each round, we chose both the exact % chance of winning and the Reporter's estimate based off of the threshold you entered.  
        <br>
        <br>
        We said that the estimations were determined by previous participants because we're interested in how people evaluate the truth of information in real-world scenarios.
        We wanted our participants in this study to believe that they were seeing approximations that real people had created.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Why does it matter?</strong>
        <br>
        Your participation helps us answer research questions, which in turn has implications for public figures, policy, and law.
        We are committed to sharing our research findings in ways that are accessible and relevant to the public.
